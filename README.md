# Feedback between SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, vaccination rollout and compliance to social distancing

DOI for this GitHub repository DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5519368


## Overview

We investigated the impact of the feedback between compliance, the incidence of infection, and vaccination coverage on the success of a vaccination programme in the population where waning of compliance depends on vaccine coverage.


## DATA

We used publically available data that we downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org . We extracted relevant to our research sections and saved them in a new .csv file. All data files reside in *Main/DataVaccine2* folder.


## Model
We coded and analysed the model using script and function that were implemented in MATLAB R2020b. The script and functions necessary to produce figures in both the main text and the supplementary material can be found in the folder *Main*.


## Figures

Figures in .fig and .eps format can be found in *Main/Figures* and *Main/SMFigures* folders, for the main text and the supplementary materials, respectively.
